//READ BEFORE PLAYING THE GAME

**STEP 1, START THE GAME:**
 1. Click run
 2. The game will prompt you to select your Pokemon. Type 1 for Greninja, 2 for Blaziken, 3 for Torterra, 4 for Gengar, 5 for Machamp and 6 for Gardevoir. 
 3. Select three pokemon, one at a time
 4. The program will then give the three remaining pokemon to the CPU
 
 **STEP 2, OTHER BATTLE MECHANICS:**
 5. Both the CPU and the player will send out the first pokemon they have picked
 6. You as the player have the option to type 1, 2, 3, 4, m, v or s
 7. If you type m, you can display your moves stats and typing, this will not count as using your turn.
 8. If you type v, you can view your pokemons typing and stats, this will not count as using your turn.
 9. If you type s, you are able to switch to your other 2 pokemon, type 2 for the second pokemon and 3 for the third pokemon, this will count as your turn.
 
 **STEP 3, USING MOVES: 
8. If you type 1, 2, 3 or 4 it will select a move to use against the opponent.**
9. **Each move is different and has their own typing, power, can reduce stats, and attack category(physical, special and status)**
10. Moves are 1.5x as strong if they match your current pokemon's typing(e.g Greninja is a water/dark type so dark pulse is 1.5x as strong)
11. Moves are 2x as strong if they are supereffective against the opposing pokemon's typing(E.g Machamp using dynamic punch against greninja will do 3x the damage as it is fighting move and machamp is a fighting type, and fighting is super effective against dark)
12. Moves are 0.5x as strong if they are not very effective against the opposing pokemon's typing(e.g fire move used on water type)
13. Moves can be 4x as strong if a move used is supereffective against both pokemon's typing's, 0.25x as strong if not very effective against both pokemon's typing, or do 0x the damage if the move used does not effect the opposing pokemon(e.g fighting moves do no damage against ghost types), see pokemon type chart if you want more info: https://rankedboost.com/pokemon-lets-go/type-chart/ 
14.  If the move being used has category physical, it will use your attack stat and the opponents defense stat in the damage calculation.
15. If the move being used has category special, it will use your special attack stat and the opponents special defense stat in the damage calculation.
16. If the move being used has category status, it does no damage however grants the user a stat boost(e.g synthesis heals hp by 50%)
17. Certain moves can lower the opponents stats while also doing damage at the cost of doing less damage(e.g icy wind lower's opponents speed)
18. Certain moves do more damage at the cost of afflicting recoil (e.g flare blitz)
19. Certain moves have "priority" which means regardless of speed, the user will go first that turn

**STEP 4, BATTLE:**
20. You battle a cpu who's move are random, who moves first in the turn is decided by this:
21. If the user switches that is the guaranteed first move however the pokemon being switched in cannot attack and must take the opponents attack. 
22. If the user uses protect it is guaranteed to go first.
23. If the user uses a move with priority it will go first unless the opposing pokemon uses a priority move in which case the pokemon with the higher speed will attack first.
24. If no moves with priority are used, pokemon with the higher speed will go first
25. If a pokemon's hp depletes to 0 after being attacked and it has not moved yet, it cannot be used anymore and its turn is lost, you are forced to switch out and the pokemon who's hp is zero cannot be switched into anymore.
26. If either the opponent or the user defeat all three other pokemon, they are the winner!

**HAVE FUN!**
